# Luzifer / vault-bootstrap

This repository contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook to set up a [ScaleWay](https://www.scaleway.com/) machine containing a standalone [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) server configured to use a MySQLd as its backend. SSL configuration is made by [nginx-letsencrypt](https://github.com/Luzifer/nginx-letsencrypt) and therefore automatically renewed.
